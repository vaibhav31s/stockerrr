# ✅ AI Features - Model Update Complete

## 🔧 Fixed Issues

### Problem:
All AI endpoints were using `gemini-pro` which was deprecated by Google and returned 404 errors:
```
models/gemini-pro is not found for API version v1beta
```

### Solution:
Updated all AI endpoints to use `gemini-2.5-flash` (same model as the working news/sentiment API)

## 📝 Updated Files

All AI API endpoints now use `gemini-2.5-flash`:

1. ✅ `/src/app/api/ai/chat/route.ts` - AI Chat Assistant
2. ✅ `/src/app/api/ai/deep-analysis/route.ts` - Deep Analysis
3. ✅ `/src/app/api/ai/compare/route.ts` - Stock Comparison
4. ✅ `/src/app/api/ai/portfolio-advice/route.ts` - Portfolio Optimization
5. ✅ `/src/app/api/ai/risk-score/route.ts` - Risk Score Calculator

const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: 'gemini-2.5-flash' })
