# 🔧 ESLint Build Error - Complete Fix Guide

## 🐛 Error Message
```bash
./src/app/auth/login/page.tsx
125:18  Error: `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.

```

## ✅ Fix Already Applied

The code has been fixed:
```tsx
// Line 125 in src/app/auth/login/page.tsx
Don&apos;t have an account?  ✅ CORRECT
```

**If you're still seeing the error**, it's due to **cached build files**.

## 🔨 Solution: Clear All Caches

### Option 1: Quick Clean (Recommended)

Run these commands in order:

```bash
# 1. Clear Next.js build cache
rm -rf .next

# 2. Clear ESLint cache
rm -f .eslintcache

# 3. Rebuild
pnpm build
```

### Option 2: Use Clean Build Script

I created a script for you:

```bash
# Make it executable
chmod +x clean-build.sh

# Run it
./clean-build.sh
```

### Option 3: Nuclear Option (If above doesn't work)

```bash
# Clear everything
rm -rf .next node_modules .eslintcache

# Reinstall dependencies
pnpm install

# Build
pnpm build
```

## 📋 Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Stop Development Server
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running pnpm dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Caches
```bash
cd /Users/vaibhavgawad/Desktop/Stockkap

# Remove build cache
rm -rf .next

# Remove ESLint cache
rm -f .eslintcache
```

### Step 3: Verify File is Fixed
```bash
# Check line 125
cat src/app/auth/login/page.tsx | sed -n '125p'

# Should show:
# Don&apos;t have an account?{' '}
```

### Step 4: Build Again
```bash
pnpm build
```

### Step 5: Expected Output
```bash

✓ Linting and checking validity of types
✓ Collecting page data
✓ Generating static pages (5/5)
✓ Finalizing page optimization

## 🧪 Verify the Fix

### Method 1: Check the File
```bash
grep -n "Don" src/app/auth/login/page.tsx
```

Should show:
```
125:              Don&apos;t have an account?{' '}
```

### Method 2: Run ESLint Manually
```bash
pnpm next lint
```

Should show:
```
✔ No ESLint warnings or errors
```

## 🎯 Why This Happens

### The Issue
ESLint rule `react/no-unescaped-entities` requires special characters in JSX to be escaped:

**Characters that need escaping:**
- `'` → `&apos;` or `&#39;`
- `"` → `&quot;`
- `<` → `&lt;`
- `>` → `&gt;`
- `&` → `&amp;`

### Why Cache Causes Problems
1. Next.js caches build output in `.next/`
2. ESLint caches results in `.eslintcache`
3. Even after fixing code, cached errors can persist
4. Clearing caches forces a fresh build

---

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Verify the Fix is Actually There
```bash
# Open the file
cat src/app/auth/login/page.tsx | grep -A2 -B2 "have an account"
```

Should show:
```tsx
<div className="text-center text-sm text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-400">
  Don&apos;t have an account?{' '}
  <Link 
```

### Check 2: Look for Other Unescaped Characters
```bash
# Search for potential issues
grep -rn "Don't\|can't\|won't" src/app/auth/
```

Should return **no matches** in JSX (only in comments is OK)

### Check 3: Disable ESLint Rule (Last Resort)
If you absolutely can't fix it, you can disable the rule in `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "extends": "next/core-web-vitals",
  "rules": {
    "react/no-unescaped-entities": "off"
  }
}
```

**⚠️ Not recommended!** Better to fix the actual issue.
