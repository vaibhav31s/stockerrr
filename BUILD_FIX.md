# ✅ Build Error Fixed - ESLint Issue

## 🐛 Error Encountered

```bash
./src/app/auth/login/page.tsx
125:18  Error: `'` can be escaped with `&apos;`, `&lsquo;`, `&#39;`, `&rsquo;`.
react/no-unescaped-entities
```

## 🔧 What Was Wrong

**File**: `src/app/auth/login/page.tsx` (Line 125)

**Before:**
```tsx
Don't have an account?  ❌
```

**After:**
```tsx
Don&apos;t have an account?  ✅
```

---

## 📝 Why This Happens

React/ESLint requires apostrophes and quotes in JSX to be escaped to avoid:
1. Syntax errors with quotes
2. XSS vulnerabilities
3. Rendering issues

**Common escapes:**
- `'` → `&apos;` or `&#39;`
- `"` → `&quot;`
- `<` → `&lt;`
- `>` → `&gt;`
- `&` → `&amp;`

---

## ✅ Fixed

Changed:
```tsx
// Before
Don't have an account?

// After
Don&apos;t have an account?
```
